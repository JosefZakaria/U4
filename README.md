Multithreaded Java Application

This project is a multithreaded Java application demonstrating thread coordination, synchronization techniques, and safe access to shared resources. It follows a clear MVC-inspired structure and integrates a simple GUI for visualizing thread activity.

**Features**
Producer–consumer architecture
Bounded buffer (shared storage)
Semaphore-based synchronization
Mutex for thread-safe access
Multiple threads running concurrently
GUI showing real-time progress and operations

**Technical Highlights**
Manual implementation of semaphores and synchronization (no external libraries)
Demonstrates understanding of race conditions, critical sections, and thread blocking
Clean separation between controller, model, and view
Robust handling of shared resources
Documentation

**The project includes:**
UML class diagram
UML sequence diagram explaining thread interaction
Written explanation of design choices and synchronization strategy

**Running the Application**
Open the project in any Java-compatible IDE and run the MainProgram class.
No additional setup required.
